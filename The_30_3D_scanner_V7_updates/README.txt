# Summary

Firstly, a big thank you to Thingiverse for featuring this design!
Secondly, since it has been featured i'm getting asked lots of questions, please bear with me, i will try and answer them as quickly as i can.. sorry in advance if i forget!

If you're looking for a 3D printer with a massive build volume, this one is incredible value for money
https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_701649.html?lkid=12386232
I have added some new parts to mine from here https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2580773
This costs about $8 in extra parts but will take this printer from being a bit lame, to being easily one of the best large 3D printers out there. (better for more advanced users)

If you want a large build volume printer, with none of the hassle and 30min assembly time, The Anet E12 is incredible! From out of the box to first print within 1 hour. Full review coming soon. 
https://www.gearbest.com/printers/pp_1072330.html?lkid=12666474
(This is great for everyone! Beginners to Advanced will all love this!)


If you're looking for a great value 3D printer and don't mind building it yourself, this one works great for me! (better for beginners)

**************This 3D printed design will turn your iPhone into a cheap portable 3D scanner utilising the AWESOME Autodesk Remake software

https://remake.autodesk.com******************

Sadly Autodesk have decided to retire Remake and rebrand it as Recap Photo, which needs a premium subscription. This puts it way out of most peoples grasp.

Fear Not!
There is a free personal version of 3DF Zephyr available for you to play with.
The work flow is very similar to Remake. 
https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-free/
------------------
------------------

The idea is that you use your phones onboard camera to take the pictures while the turn table rotates. This is acheived by using the headphones that were supplied new in the box

The volume controllers trigger the camera remotely, taking 55 pictures for every complete rotation of the turntable.

# FAQ

## How do i pay you $30 for this?

It's Free!

the $30 refers to an approximate PLA filament cost

## What files do i need to use to print the scanner?

For the most part you will need
V2_chassis_cog_cover.stl
V2_cog.stl
V2_crank_handle_1.stl
V2_crank_handle_2.stl
V2_crank_wheel.stl
V2_iphone_cradle.stl (this is also OK for other phones it's just the name)
V4_Main_Chassis_1.stl (Updated 15/05/17 to allow lightening and USB C connectors to fit)
V2_Main_Chassis_2.stl
V3_Main_Chassis_3.stl
V2_Main_Chassis_4.stl
V2_Main_Chassis_combined.stl (V6 Update, use this is you have a printer big enough to print the base as 1 piece)
V2_stopper.stl (this is optional and is used to secure the headphone volume in place)
V2_Turn_Table.stl

Now if you find that V2_Turn_table.stl is too big for your build plate, you can download this as 3 seperate parts:
V3_Turn_Table_Split_1.stl
V3_Turn_Table_Split_2.stl
V3_Turn_Table_Split_3.stl

There is also a new version of the cog cover with a flange to help keep the turn table in place when using it with light objects. This will need to be glued in place

V4 chassis cog cover with Turn table support.stl
 (This is now at V4 as of 08/06/17, it has been thickened to allow for a sturdy, support free print.)

From 02/11/17 The turntable has a 5 pcs split version so it can be printed on a 6" build plate
Use files
V3_Turn_Table_Split_1.stl
Turntable Split 5pcs 1.stl
Turntable Split 5pcs 3.stl
Turntable Split 5pcs 4.stl
Turntable Split 5pcs 2.stl

##  What App do you use?

I use Autodesk Remake. There is a free trial available. There are other photogrammetry software packages available, so it's worth having a look around. This is a PC app, not a mobile app

There are also Opensource options available, using VisualSFM, Meshlab and Blender. A brilliant tutorial has been done i have added the link in the video section below. It's excellent and a complete walkthrough. Amazing work!

## Does this work with Android phone?

Yes, the turn table is designed to trigger your phones camera to take 50 pictures per full revolution. You use these photos with Autodesk Remake to create the 3D scan

##  The turntable is too big for my printer, can it be scaled down?

There have been some successful prints at 80% the original size, so yes but i recommend not going much smaller

## Is there a version of the turntable part, split in two?

Yes, the wonderful Thingiverse community have added a few remixes, check them out on the remixes button
There is now a V3 turntable that has been split into 3 parts and should fit most printers

## Does it need to print with supports?

The majority will print support free, but you will need supports for the main chassis. these are minimal however.

## My iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack, can i still use it?

Yes you can, just use the included headphones that came with it.

# Updates

## V7 Updates

The Turntable has a 5 pcs split version so it can be printed on a 6" build plate

## V6 Update

You can now print the main chassis as 1 single piece. You'll need a printer with a large build volume, but it's another option for you

## Update V5

V4 chassis cog cover with Turn table support.stl

This is now at V4 as of 08/06/17, it has been thickened to allow for a sturdy, support free print

## Update V4

V4 Improvements

V4_Main_Chassis_1.stl Updated to allow lightening and USB C connectors to fit

## Update V3

V3 improvements

1. Turntable now split into 3 parts for easier printing, the unsplit part will remain for anyone who has a big enough printer volume
2. Main Chassis split 1 and 3 are now V3. The ledges have been thickened up, and support material will now be easier to remove
3.There is also a new version of the cog cover with a flange to help keep the turn table in place when using it with light objects. This will need to be glued in place
V3 chassis cog cover with Turn table support.stl


## Update V2

V2.0beta is now available for download!

The base is now in 4 separate parts that press fit together and the tolerancing on other press fit parts has been improved.

The iPhone Cradle is now also Height Adjustable to allow for further tweakablility and allow scanning of smaller items

(If you have already printed all the parts but just want to upgrade the main chassis, that will be no problem as the design is backward compatible)



# Awards

## Pinshape.com 's Functional Design 2016

I won the Top Functional Design in the 2016 Pinshape Awards! Thanks to all who voted! http://bit.ly/2j62lb0

## The Formlabs Design Awards - Top Functional Model

In celebration of FUSE, Formlabs' first user conference, we are hosting the Formlabs 3D Design Awards, Powered by Pinshape.

The Formlabs Design Awards, powered by Pinshape, celebrated designs from the 3D printing communityâ€™s top contributors. Designs were nominated for one of three categories: Top Art and Design Model, Top Functional Model, and Top Educational Model. The results of public voting are in! Scroll on to learn about the winners for each category.

Top Functional Model
The Top Functional Model award goes to Daveyclk for his design, The $30 3D Scanner. This clever model can be entirely 3D printed. It works by using a smartphone to take a number of images and stitch them together via a process called photogrammetry. Congratulations and we hope the Solidworks and Instructables memberships help you to keep innovating!
