# Summary

Ever forget to grab plastic utensils on your lunch break? Yeah, me too. Don't worry, I got you covered! Instead of wasting valuable time trying to find something to eat your meal with, just pull one of these out!!
Keep one of these in your wallet or purse just in case!
These little guys print fast, like less than an hour fast. And they're the same size as a credit card (just thicker) so they don't take up a lot of space. 
They're ergonomically designed to work well even with their small form factor!

UPDATE ONE
I've decided to add a version that has a spoon! (CC_cutlery-V2-KNIFE-SPOON)
I'm going to work on a spork next :) 
UPDATE TWO
I've added a spoon/fork combo! (CC_cutlery-V3-SPOON-FORK)
I've also updated the names of the files to be a bit more descriptive, the files themselves are unchanged, just their names.
UPDATE THREE
The long awaited spork is here!!

This should probably be printed out of 'food safe' filament, but since they're not meant to be used every day, you should be okay to use a standard PLA (Do NOT use ABS).
But since I don't want anyone getting sick because of what I said, 
PLEASE USE FOOD SAFE FILAMENT!!!

I'm listing this as "Work in progress" because I feel like the design could still be tweaked and made better.
If you have any ideas, please let me know!
