# Summary

This functional platform jack prints fully assembled without supports.   

UPDATE [7/21/2015]: We have uploaded an updated platform jack with stronger scissor arms, improved axles to stop the arms from separating, and a larger gap between the screw and crossbeam to fix the fusing issue. We printed the updated version with a 0.3mm layer height and 15% infill in 4 hours.  

UPDATE [7/22/2015]:  For anyone having problems with the scissor arms fusing together we have uploaded a modified file with the tolerance increased from 0.5 to 0.65 mm (The axle tolerance is unchanged).

# Instructions

This model prints fully assembled without supports. Our print time for the original model was 6 hours on a Replicator 2. We printed it with a 0.2 mm layer height, 15% infill, and a raft. **The screw will be fused to the top crossbeam initially, but if you give it a *clockwise* twist it should separate and turn freely. Before attempting to twist the screw, inspect the print to make sure that none of the pieces are fused together.**   

The updated model was printed in 4 hours on a Replicator 2 with a 0.3mm layer height and 15% infill.  

The jack extends 10.5 cm. The updated jack was able to support 20 pounds before failing (while fully extended).
