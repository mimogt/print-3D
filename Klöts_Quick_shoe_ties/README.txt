# Summary

<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:938561#tip"><b><u>Remember to leave me a tip</u></a> if you think that my work is great! As a student I really appreciate it!</b>

Smart and cool way to tie your shoes fast.  

Why are Klöts better than normal shoelaces?  
- It is faster way to tie your shoes.  
- They look personal and cool.  
- They will always stay at the same tension. (Super useful for sports)  
- There is no unnecessary ends of shoelaces hanging.  
- Fully customizable  

!!! Remember to thread Klöts flat side pointing up. Curvy side will press against your shoe to make sure that shoelaces will pull Klöts away from each other not down. When the pull is away from each other it prevents Klöts open in action!!!  

There are 3 different models available:  

Klöts 3 - For small shoes and kids shoes  
Klöts 4 - For average sized shoes  
Klöts 5 - For big shoes and boots

Added strips to make Klöts look even cooler and more personal.  

How to use?  
1. Print Klöts (and strips)  
(1.2 Super glue strips in place)  
2. Undo your shoelaces  
3. Thread shoelaces through Klöts  
4. Make sure that the tension is right  
5. In the end make really tight knots  
6. Put the rest of your shoelaces into the shoes.
