# Summary

I tried a lot of released bag clips, but most of them are only working with ABS material since it is more flexible.  
So I tried to design a clip which also works with PLA.  
I used a hinge instead of a spring mechanism. The Clip itself is designed to be printed as four shells to provide the necessary flexibility .  

The hole thing is printed as one piece and should be came out nicely and moveable without any support material.  

Bigger clips are following.  

UPDATE 08.08.2015: Clip with 85mm Length added
UPDATE 17.12.2017: Clip with 125mm Length added

# Instructions

-Optimized for a nozzle diameter of 0.4mm  
-Shells: 2  
-Infill: 30-40 % should be enough
